## 1. Preparing Your Package for npm
Before you can publish your package to npm, ensure that itâ€™s ready for distribution. Follow these steps:

### 1.1. Create a package.json file
If you don't already have a `package.json` file in your project, generate one using:

```bash
npm init

{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

node_modules/
test/
logs/

npm adduser
